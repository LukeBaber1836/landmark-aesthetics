#### How does it work and what are the benefits?

Massage therapy involves the manipulation of soft tissues—including muscles, tendons, and ligaments—to promote relaxation, improve circulation, and alleviate pain. Our skilled massage therapists use various techniques tailored to your specific needs, from Swedish massage for relaxation to deep tissue work for chronic tension. Benefits include reduced muscle tension and stress, improved blood circulation, enhanced flexibility and range of motion, relief from chronic pain and headaches, better sleep quality, and an overall sense of well-being and relaxation.

#### What you should do before treatment?

Before your massage therapy session, it is important to:

- Communicate any health conditions, injuries, or areas of concern with your massage therapist.
- Avoid eating a heavy meal within 1-2 hours before your appointment.
- Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water before your session.
- Arrive a few minutes early to fill out any necessary forms and discuss your preferences with your therapist.
- Wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing that's easy to change out of.

#### During the procedure

During your massage therapy session, you'll be welcomed into a calm, soothing environment designed for relaxation. Your therapist will discuss your specific needs, preferences, and any areas of discomfort before beginning. You'll lie on a comfortable massage table, draped with sheets for privacy and warmth, with only the area being worked on exposed. Your therapist will use various techniques—such as Swedish, deep tissue, hot stone, or prenatal massage—applying appropriate pressure based on your comfort level. Sessions typically last between 45 minutes to 90 minutes depending on the type of massage selected. You're encouraged to communicate throughout the session about pressure preferences and comfort.

#### Aftercare and recovery

After your massage therapy session, it is important to follow these aftercare instructions:

- Drink plenty of water to help flush out toxins released during the massage and prevent dehydration.
- Take it easy for the rest of the day and avoid strenuous activities to allow your body to fully benefit from the treatment.
- Apply heat or ice to any areas that feel sore, as mild soreness is normal after deep tissue work.
- Take a warm bath with Epsom salts to further relax muscles and enhance the benefits of your massage.
- Listen to your body and rest if needed—the relaxation effects can make you feel sleepy.

### Maintaining results

To maintain the benefits of massage therapy and support your overall wellness, consider scheduling regular sessions based on your needs and lifestyle. For stress management and general wellness, monthly massages can help maintain relaxation and prevent tension buildup. If you're dealing with chronic pain or recovering from an injury, more frequent sessions—such as bi-weekly or weekly—may be recommended initially. Many clients find that incorporating massage into their self-care routine leads to lasting improvements in physical comfort, mental clarity, and emotional well-being.
