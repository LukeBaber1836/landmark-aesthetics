#### How does it work and what are the benefits?

IV infusion therapy is a convenient and effective way to deliver hydration, vitamins, and nutrients directly into your bloodstream for maximum absorption. By bypassing the digestive system, IV therapy ensures that essential nutrients reach your cells quickly and efficiently, providing immediate benefits that oral supplements cannot match.

During your visit, we'll review your health history and wellness goals to recommend the IV infusion that best fits your needs. Each infusion is administered by trained medical professionals in a comfortable, relaxing environment. Benefits include enhanced hydration and energy levels, immune system support and faster recovery from illness, improved athletic performance and post-workout recovery, relief from fatigue, brain fog, and stress, and rapid nutrient absorption for maximum effectiveness. We offer customized formulations including Vitamin C, Glutathione, Myers Cocktail, and more to address your specific wellness needs.

#### What you should do before treatment?

Before your IV infusion therapy session, it is important to:

- Eat a light meal or snack 1-2 hours before your appointment to help prevent lightheadedness.
- Drink plenty of water before arriving to ensure you're well-hydrated.
- Wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing with sleeves that can be easily rolled up.
- Inform your provider about any medications, supplements, or medical conditions during your consultation.
- Arrive with any specific wellness goals or concerns you'd like to address with your treatment.

#### During the procedure

During your IV infusion session, you'll relax in a comfortable chair in a peaceful, spa-like environment. After discussing your health goals, a trained medical professional will select the appropriate IV formula and insert a small catheter into a vein in your arm. The infusion will begin, delivering a customized blend of vitamins, minerals, and nutrients directly into your bloodstream.

Most sessions last between 30-60 minutes depending on the specific treatment selected. During this time, you can read, listen to music, work on your phone or laptop, or simply relax. The process is generally painless, though you may feel a slight cool sensation as the fluids enter your body. Our staff will monitor you throughout the treatment to ensure your comfort and safety.

#### Aftercare and recovery

After your IV infusion therapy session, it is important to follow these aftercare instructions:

- Continue drinking plenty of water throughout the day to support hydration and nutrient absorption.
- Avoid strenuous exercise for 2-3 hours after your treatment to allow your body to fully absorb the nutrients.
- Keep the insertion site clean and dry; remove the bandage after a few hours.
- Monitor how you feel and note any improvements in energy, hydration, or overall wellness.
- Contact us if you experience any unusual symptoms or have concerns following your treatment.

### Maintaining results

The benefits of IV infusion therapy can be felt immediately and may last several days to weeks, depending on your individual needs and the specific treatment received. For ongoing wellness support, many clients benefit from regular IV therapy sessions. We may recommend weekly treatments for acute needs like illness recovery or athletic training, monthly infusions for general wellness maintenance, or seasonal boosters during times of increased stress or immune challenges. Your provider will work with you to create a personalized schedule that aligns with your health goals and lifestyle, ensuring you continue to feel revitalized and energized.
