#### How does it work and what are the benefits?

Dr. Baber's favorite treatment! A laser consultation is the first step toward advanced skin rejuvenation and long-lasting results. During this personalized appointment, one of our experienced and licensed medical professionals will evaluate your skin concerns, review your aesthetic goals, and determine which laser or energy-based treatment is best suited for you.

We specialize in cutting-edge technologies including Fotona 4D, HALO™, BroadBand Light, and Profound®—each designed to address specific skin concerns through precise, controlled energy delivery. These advanced treatments can effectively address skin laxity and loss of firmness, fine lines and wrinkles, sun damage and age spots, uneven skin texture and tone, enlarged pores, and overall skin quality improvement.

Benefits include dramatic skin rejuvenation with minimal downtime, customized treatment plans tailored to your unique needs, long-lasting results that improve over time, non-invasive or minimally invasive options, and comprehensive care from consultation through recovery. Your provider will explain how each technology works, what to expect during treatment, recovery time, and anticipated results to ensure you feel informed and confident.

#### What you should do before treatment?

Before your laser consultation, it is important to:

- Avoid sun exposure and tanning (including self-tanners) for at least 2-4 weeks before your appointment, as tanned skin can affect treatment safety and results.
- Discontinue use of retinoids, alpha hydroxy acids, and other exfoliating products for 3-7 days prior to consultation.
- Arrive with a clean face—avoid wearing makeup, lotions, or skincare products on the day of your consultation.
- Compile a list of current medications, supplements, and any previous cosmetic treatments you've had.
- Bring photos or examples of your desired results and prepare questions about the treatment process, recovery, and expected outcomes.

#### During the procedure

During your laser consultation, you'll meet one-on-one with an experienced and licensed medical professional in a private, comfortable setting. Your provider will conduct a thorough skin analysis, examining areas of concern and assessing your skin type, condition, and treatment goals. We'll discuss your medical history and any factors that may affect treatment planning.

Your provider will explain the different laser and energy-based technologies available—including Fotona 4D for skin tightening and rejuvenation, HALO™ for hybrid fractional resurfacing, BroadBand Light for pigmentation and texture, and Profound® for deep dermal remodeling. Together, you'll create a customized treatment plan that addresses your specific needs safely and effectively, including expected number of sessions, recovery time, and anticipated results. Treatment options and timelines will be discussed, and if appropriate, your first session can be scheduled based on your goals and availability.

#### Aftercare and recovery

After your laser consultation and any subsequent treatments, it is important to follow these aftercare instructions:

- Strictly avoid sun exposure and wear a broad-spectrum SPF 30+ sunscreen daily to protect treated skin.
- Follow your provider's specific post-treatment care instructions, which may include gentle cleansing, prescribed ointments, and avoiding certain products.
- Expect some redness, swelling, or mild discomfort depending on the treatment—this is normal and typically resolves within a few days to a week.
- Avoid strenuous exercise, hot showers, saunas, and swimming pools for the recommended period post-treatment.
- Contact your provider immediately if you experience unusual symptoms such as severe pain, blistering, or signs of infection.

### Maintaining results

Laser treatment results develop progressively as your skin heals and produces new collagen, with continued improvement visible over several weeks to months. Depending on the specific treatment and your skin concerns, you may need a series of 2-4 sessions spaced several weeks apart for optimal results. Results can last anywhere from several months to several years depending on the treatment type, your skin condition, and how well you maintain your skin with proper sun protection and skincare.

To preserve and enhance your results, we recommend following a customized skincare regimen, scheduling periodic maintenance treatments, and protecting your skin from sun damage. Many clients return annually for touch-up treatments to maintain their rejuvenated appearance and address new signs of aging as they occur.
