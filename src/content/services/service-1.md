#### How does it work and what are the benefits?

Botox injections work by temporarily paralyzing the muscles responsible for wrinkles and fine lines. The active ingredient, botulinum toxin, blocks nerve signals to these muscles, preventing them from contracting. This results in a smoother and more youthful appearance of the skin.

#### What you should do before treatment?

Before undergoing Botox treatment, it is important to:

- Avoid alcohol and blood-thinning medications for at least 24 hours prior to the procedure.
- Inform your practitioner about any medical conditions or allergies you may have.
- Avoid other facial treatments, such as chemical peels or laser therapy, for at least two weeks before the procedure.

#### During the procedure

During the Botox procedure, a trained practitioner will use a fine needle to inject small amounts of Botox into the targeted muscles. The procedure is relatively quick, typically taking about 10-15 minutes, and is usually well-tolerated with minimal discomfort. You may experience slight redness or swelling at the injection sites, which typically subsides within a few hours.

#### Aftercare and recovery

After the procedure, it is important to follow these aftercare instructions:

- Avoid rubbing or massaging the treated areas for at least 24 hours to prevent the spread of Botox to unintended muscles.
- Refrain from strenuous exercise and excessive heat exposure (such as saunas or hot tubs) for 24 hours after treatment.
- Stay upright for at least four hours post-treatment to minimize the risk of Botox migrating to other areas.

### Maintaining results

To maintain the results of your Botox treatment, it is recommended to schedule follow-up treatments every three to four months. Regular treatments can help prolong the effects and keep your skin looking smooth and youthful.
