#### How does it work and what are the benefits?

Our Weight Loss and Wellness Consultation is a personalized, one-on-one appointment designed to help you achieve safe and sustainable results. During this visit, a licensed medical provider will review your health history, discuss your weight loss goals, and determine if medical weight loss therapies are appropriate options for you.

We specialize in GLP-1 therapy, which works by regulating appetite, improving metabolism, and supporting healthy weight management when combined with lifestyle changes. Your provider will explain how the therapy works, discuss potential benefits and side effects, and develop a customized plan tailored to your needs. Additionally, we offer B12, Lipo-B12, peptide injectables, and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to help aid your weight loss and wellness goals.

This consultation is your opportunity to ask questions, understand your options, and create a realistic roadmap toward your health and wellness goals. Benefits include personalized medical guidance tailored to your unique needs, access to evidence-based weight loss therapies including GLP-1 medications, comprehensive support combining medical treatments with lifestyle modifications, improved energy levels and metabolic health, and safe, effective care with ongoing monitoring and support.

#### What you should do before treatment?

Before your weight loss and wellness consultation, it is important to:

- Complete any pre-consultation forms or health questionnaires provided to help us understand your background.
- Keep a food diary for at least 3-7 days before your appointment to help identify eating patterns.
- List any current medications, supplements, or vitamins you're taking.
- Write down your specific goals, concerns, and any questions you'd like to address during the consultation.
- Be prepared to discuss your medical history, including any previous weight loss attempts and their outcomes.

#### During the procedure

During your 30-minute wellness consultation, you'll meet one-on-one with a licensed medical provider in a comfortable, private setting. The session will include a detailed discussion about your health history, current lifestyle, dietary habits, and weight loss goals. We'll assess factors that may be affecting your weight, such as stress levels, sleep patterns, and physical activity.

Your provider will take measurements and may review any relevant health markers or lab results you've brought. If appropriate, they'll discuss whether GLP-1 therapy or other medical weight loss options like B12, Lipo-B12, peptide injectables, or hormone replacement therapy (HRT) could support your goals. Together, you'll develop a customized treatment plan that outlines specific, achievable steps toward your wellness goals. You'll leave with clear recommendations, a better understanding of your options, and the support you need to feel confident every step of the way.

#### Aftercare and recovery

After your consultation, it is important to follow these guidelines:

- Review the personalized plan provided and begin implementing the recommended changes gradually.
- Start tracking your progress using the tools and methods discussed during your consultation.
- Stay in communication with our wellness team—reach out with questions or concerns as they arise.
- Schedule your follow-up appointments to maintain accountability and adjust your plan as needed.
- Be patient with yourself and celebrate small victories along the way—sustainable change takes time.

### Maintaining results

Achieving and maintaining weight loss and wellness is an ongoing journey that requires commitment and support. We recommend scheduling regular follow-up consultations—typically every 2-4 weeks initially—to monitor your progress, address challenges, and adjust your plan as needed. As you reach your goals, less frequent check-ins can help you maintain your results long-term. Many clients find that ongoing support through periodic consultations helps them stay motivated, accountable, and on track with their wellness objectives, leading to lasting lifestyle changes and improved health outcomes.
