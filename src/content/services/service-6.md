#### How does it work and what are the benefits?

Dermal fillers are injectable treatments that restore volume, smooth wrinkles, and enhance facial contours using hyaluronic acid-based gels. These FDA-approved products work by adding volume beneath the skin's surface, filling in lines and wrinkles, and stimulating natural collagen production. Dermal fillers can address volume loss in the cheeks and temples, enhance and define lips, smooth nasolabial folds and marionette lines, contour the jawline and chin, and fill under-eye hollows.

During your consultation, one of our licensed medical professionals will evaluate your facial structure, listen to your concerns, and discuss your aesthetic goals. We'll explain the different filler options available and create a customized treatment plan focused on subtle, natural results that enhance your features and beauty. Benefits include immediate visible results, non-surgical enhancement with minimal downtime, long-lasting effects (6-18 months depending on the product), natural-looking outcomes that respect your unique features, and the ability to gradually build results over time.

#### What you should do before treatment?

Before your dermal filler consultation and treatment, it is important to:

- Avoid blood-thinning medications, supplements (such as aspirin, ibuprofen, fish oil, and vitamin E), and alcohol for at least 48-72 hours prior to minimize bruising.
- Stay well-hydrated in the days leading up to your appointment to help optimize results.
- Arrive with a clean face—avoid wearing makeup to your appointment if possible.
- Inform your provider about any previous filler treatments, allergies, or medical conditions.
- Come prepared with photos or examples of the results you're hoping to achieve, and don't hesitate to ask questions.

#### During the procedure

During your dermal filler treatment, you'll be seated comfortably as your licensed medical professional cleanses the treatment area and may apply a topical numbing cream to minimize discomfort. The filler is then carefully injected into the targeted areas using a fine needle or cannula, with the injector strategically placing the product to achieve natural, balanced enhancement.

The procedure typically takes 15-45 minutes depending on the areas being treated. You may feel slight pressure or a mild pinching sensation during injections, but most fillers contain lidocaine to help with comfort. Your provider will massage the treated areas to ensure even distribution and may ask you to look in a mirror to assess the results. If appropriate, your provider may treat you on the same day as your consultation, or schedule your treatment for a later date based on your preferences and preparation.

#### Aftercare and recovery

After your dermal filler treatment, it is important to follow these aftercare instructions:

- Avoid touching, pressing, or massaging the treated areas for at least 24-48 hours unless instructed otherwise by your provider.
- Apply ice packs for 10-15 minutes at a time to reduce swelling and bruising if needed.
- Avoid strenuous exercise, alcohol, excessive heat (saunas, hot tubs, sun exposure), and dental work for 24-48 hours after treatment.
- Sleep with your head elevated for the first night to minimize swelling.
- Contact your provider if you experience severe pain, excessive swelling, skin discoloration, or any concerning symptoms.

### Maintaining results

Dermal filler results are visible immediately and continue to improve over the following days as any swelling subsides. Depending on the type of filler used and the treatment area, results typically last between 6-18 months. Factors such as metabolism, lifestyle, and the specific product used can affect longevity. To maintain your enhanced appearance, we recommend scheduling follow-up appointments as your filler naturally breaks down. Many clients choose to return every 9-12 months for touch-ups or additional treatments. Regular maintenance treatments can help you preserve your results and may even extend the duration of effects over time as your skin continues to produce collagen.
