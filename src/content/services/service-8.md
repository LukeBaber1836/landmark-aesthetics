#### How does it work and what are the benefits?

At Landmark Aesthetics, we offer personalized facial treatments designed to address your unique skin concerns and goals. Our signature offering is the DiamondGlow® Facial, a next-level, medical-grade skin treatment that combines deep cleansing, exfoliation, extraction, and serum infusion—all in one luxurious experience. This innovative technology uses a patented diamond tip to gently resurface the skin while simultaneously delivering professional-grade serums deep into freshly exfoliated skin.

We also offer luxury facials customized by our licensed aesthetician. Each luxury facial includes a detailed skin analysis, premium products, targeted exfoliation, intensive hydration, and therapeutic facial massage. Whether you're concerned with aging, acne, dryness, dullness, or sensitivity, our aesthetician will create a treatment specifically tailored to your needs. Benefits include deeply cleansed and exfoliated skin, improved texture and tone, enhanced hydration and radiance, reduced appearance of fine lines and pores, and a relaxing, rejuvenating experience that leaves your skin refreshed, balanced, and glowing.

Don't know which facial is right for you? Don't worry! Our licensed aesthetician will go over your goals and come up with a treatment plan customized just for you!

#### What you should do before treatment?

Before your customized facial treatment, it is important to:

- Avoid using harsh exfoliants, retinoids, or chemical peels for 3-5 days before your appointment to prevent over-sensitizing your skin.
- Stay well-hydrated in the days leading up to your facial for optimal results.
- Arrive with a clean face if possible, or plan to arrive a few minutes early so we can properly cleanse your skin.
- Inform your aesthetician about any allergies, skin sensitivities, current skincare products, or recent treatments.
- Avoid excessive sun exposure and sunburn in the week prior to your appointment.

#### During the procedure

During your customized facial treatment, you'll relax in a comfortable treatment room designed for tranquility and relaxation. Your licensed aesthetician will begin with a thorough skin analysis to assess your skin type, concerns, and goals. Based on this consultation, they'll select the appropriate treatment protocol—whether that's the advanced DiamondGlow® system or a luxury facial with customized products.

Your treatment will typically include cleansing, exfoliation (either mechanical, chemical, or with the DiamondGlow® diamond tip), extractions if needed, a customized mask, serums and treatments targeted to your concerns, massage to promote circulation and relaxation, and finishing products to protect and enhance your results. If you're receiving the DiamondGlow® Facial, you'll experience the unique sensation of simultaneous exfoliation and serum infusion as the device glides across your skin. Most facial treatments last 45-75 minutes, leaving you feeling pampered and your skin visibly improved.

#### Aftercare and recovery

After your facial treatment, it is important to follow these aftercare instructions:

- Avoid touching your face unnecessarily and keep your hands clean to prevent introducing bacteria to freshly treated skin.
- Skip makeup for at least a few hours if possible to allow your skin to breathe and absorb the treatment benefits.
- Avoid strenuous exercise, hot showers, saunas, and steam rooms for 24 hours to prevent irritation.
- Use gentle, hydrating skincare products and avoid harsh actives like retinoids or acids for 24-48 hours post-treatment.
- Apply broad-spectrum sunscreen daily, as your skin may be more sensitive to sun exposure after exfoliation.

### Maintaining results

The results from your customized facial are immediate—you'll notice brighter, smoother, more radiant skin right away. However, for lasting improvements and optimal skin health, regular facial treatments are recommended. Most clients benefit from scheduling facials every 4-6 weeks to maintain their glow and address ongoing skin concerns. This consistent care helps to continuously refine skin texture, manage breakouts, maintain hydration, and slow visible signs of aging.

Your aesthetician may also recommend a personalized at-home skincare routine to extend and enhance your in-office results. With regular treatments and proper home care, you can achieve and maintain your healthiest, most beautiful skin. Many clients find that incorporating monthly facials into their self-care routine provides both aesthetic and relaxation benefits that support overall wellness.
