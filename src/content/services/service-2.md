#### How does it work and what are the benefits?

Laser hair removal uses concentrated beams of light to target and destroy hair follicles. The laser energy is absorbed by the pigment in the hair, heating the follicle and inhibiting future hair growth. This precise technology provides long-lasting reduction of unwanted hair, leaving your skin smooth and hair-free. Benefits include reduced ingrown hairs, less skin irritation compared to shaving or waxing, and significant time savings in your daily grooming routine.

#### What you should do before treatment?

Before undergoing laser hair removal treatment, it is important to:

- Avoid sun exposure and tanning for at least 4-6 weeks before treatment, as tanned skin can increase the risk of side effects.
- Shave the treatment area 24 hours before your appointment (do not wax or pluck).
- Avoid using products containing retinoids or alpha hydroxy acids for 2-3 days prior to treatment.
- Inform your practitioner about any medications you're taking, especially photosensitizing drugs.
- Clean the treatment area thoroughly and avoid applying lotions, deodorants, or makeup on the day of treatment.

#### During the procedure

During your laser hair removal session, you'll be provided with protective eyewear to shield your eyes from the laser light. The practitioner will apply a cooling gel to the treatment area to enhance comfort and protect your skin. A handheld laser device is then moved across the skin, delivering pulses of light that target the hair follicles. You may feel a slight snapping sensation, similar to a rubber band against the skin. Treatment time varies depending on the area being treated, ranging from a few minutes for small areas to up to an hour for larger areas.

#### Aftercare and recovery

After the procedure, it is important to follow these aftercare instructions:

- Apply a cold compress or aloe vera gel to soothe any redness or sensitivity in the treated area.
- Avoid sun exposure and always use a broad-spectrum SPF 30+ sunscreen on treated areas when outdoors.
- Refrain from hot showers, saunas, steam rooms, and strenuous exercise for 24-48 hours after treatment.
- Do not pick, scratch, or exfoliate the treated area for at least one week.
- Avoid waxing, plucking, or using depilatory creams between sessions—you may shave if needed.

### Maintaining results

Laser hair removal typically requires a series of 6-8 treatments spaced 4-6 weeks apart for optimal results, as hair grows in cycles and the laser is most effective during the active growth phase. After completing your initial treatment series, you may notice a significant reduction in hair growth. Maintenance sessions once or twice a year can help you maintain smooth, hair-free skin and address any new growth that may occur over time.
